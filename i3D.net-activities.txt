To be included/looked at
	- SSL certs (https://github.com/bitnami/containers/tree/main/bitnami/nginx#adding-custom-server-blocks)
	- Custom server blocks
	- /opt/bitnami/nginx/conf/nginx.conf. You can overwrite the nginx.conf
	- Redirects



Not a "thing"
	Database replication as it will be an external database with build in replication


Design choices:
	- Continue using NGINX as web server. Known to work
	- Run WP as a not privileged user for security reasons
	- Have WP-CLI installed as it helps with maintenance tasks
	- PHP minimal version 8
